We're super excited to launch Socialgorithm - a non-profit dedicated to organising hackathons and coding challenges.

We've just finished a Hackathon with SheCodes, UCL and Morgan Stanley, at Morgan Stanley's London HQ! More on that soon,
but if you'd like us to organise something, get in touch with us at [hello@socialgorithm.org](mailto:hello@socialgorithm.org)!
