We were invited to participate in [Tech Night London](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1170152843017561.1073741846.701527709880079&type=3),
along with [WarwickTECH](https://medium.com/@WarwickTECH) at The Shard in London, in a fantastic event that we were really proud to be a part of!

You can read more about the event itself in [this post by Diana Lee](https://medium.com/@dianaklee/a-new-approach-to-diversity-in-tech-5e5d978198f4) - organiser and She++ Ambassador in the UK.

Our role in the event was to give a coding workshop to attendees, so we took the opportunity to test for the first time our [Ultimate TTT AI workshop](/host).

Over the course of 1h the students learned about basic game theory and AI, and wrote algorithms to play against each other using our game server.
One hour of course isn't close to enough, but it made for an interesting taster session to get people excited about a longer version.

It was the first real test for our game server, documentation... and we received very useful feedback from everyone involved. Running an event like
this certainly is harder than it may seem at first!

After the workshop everyone connected their algorithms to our server for the "big battle" - where each algorithm would play against everyone else's,
and we would see the results in real time in the projector.

The winner received a Raspberry PI with plenty of accessories to make anything with it, kindly provided by Morgan Stanley.

Since it was our first event we completely forgot to write down anyone's name, including our winner... :sigh: Lessons for next time!

Anyway, see you in [our next event](/events)!
